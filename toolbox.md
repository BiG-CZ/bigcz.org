# BiG CZ Data Toolbox

The BiG CZ Data Toolbox is a single, easy-to-install, easy-to-teach cross-platform package of the ODM2 software ecosystem and power functions for accessing [BiG CZ Data Catalog](http://bigcz.org/central/) and Web services.

It will serve cyber-savvy CZ scientists with powerful tools for local data management and publication and for access, analysis and modeling of data available via the [BiG CZ Data Portal](http://bigcz.org/portal/) and other data repositories.

The BiG CZ Data Toolbox is an easy-to-install software system that includes graphical user interface (GUI) applications within an independent Python environment built upon the Conda packaging system and Conda virtual environments.
