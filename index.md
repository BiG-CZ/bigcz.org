# The BiG CZ Data Software System

The BiG CZ Data Scientific Software Integration project has integrated an open-source software stack specifically designed to solve the challenges of managing, sharing, analyzing and integrating diverse data from of biological and geological (BiG) disciplines for Critical Zone (CZ) science.

BiG CZ software <https://github.com/BiG-CZ> is being built upon the Observations Data Model v2.0 (ODM2, <http://ODM2.org>), a new information model aimed at facilitating greater interoperability across scientific disciplines and domain cyberinfrastructures that serve such diverse data as: hydrological time series, soil and sediment geochemistry, biodiversity surveys, oceanographic sensor profiles, multi-dimensional spectra, and more (Horsburgh et al. 2016).

## BiG CZ Data Portal

The BiG CZ Data Portal is a web application for intuitive, high-performance map-based discovery, access, visualization and analysis of diverse data.

## BiG CZ Data Toolbox

The BiG CZ Data Toolbox is a single, easy-to-install, easy-to-teach cross-platform package of the [ODM2 software ecosystem](https://github.com/ODM2/odm2-software-ecosystem) for managing, integrating and analyzing Critical Zone science data.
