# The BiG CZ Data Software System

The BiG CZ Data Scientific Software Integration project (NSF OAC awards [1339834](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1339834) & [1339793](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1339793)) has integrated an open-source software stack specifically designed to solve the challenges of managing, sharing, analyzing and integrating diverse data from of biological and geological (BiG) disciplines for Critical Zone (CZ) science.

[BiG CZ Data software](https://github.com/BiG-CZ) is built upon the Observations Data Model v2.0 (ODM2, <http://ODM2.org>), a new information model aimed at facilitating greater interoperability across scientific disciplines and domain cyberinfrastructures that serve such diverse data as: hydrological time series, soil and sediment geochemistry, biodiversity surveys, oceanographic sensor profiles, multi-dimensional spectra, and more ([Horsburgh et al. 2016](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2016.01.010); [Hsu et al. 2017](http://dx.doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2017-004)).

The BiG CZ Data and ODM2 software collection was showcased at our capstone [2017 BiG-CZ / ODM2 Hands-On Workshop](https://github.com/BiG-CZ/bigcz_wshp2017), held November 15-16, 2017 at University of California Riverside. The complete content of the workshop, including slides, walk-through examples and installation packages, is available at https://github.com/BiG-CZ/bigcz_wshp2017.

## BiG CZ Data Portal

The BiG CZ Data Portal is a web application for intuitive, high-performance map-based discovery, access, visualization and analysis of diverse data.
