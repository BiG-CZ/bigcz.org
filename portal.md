# BiG CZ Data Portal

The BiG CZ Data Portal is a web application for intuitive, high-performance map-based discovery, access, visualization and analysis of diverse data.

It is available at <https://portal.bigcz.org>.

It serves as an easy point of entry into the BiG CZ Data system, by combining geospatial analysis of an Area of Interest (AoI), followed by a search within that  AoI for datasets contained in three separate data catalogs (CINERGI, HydroShare,  CUAHSI Water Data Center). Read about the [BiG CZ Data Catalog](http://bigcz.org/catalog/) for more info.

The BiG CZ Data Portal is built on the WikiWatershed / Model My Watershed Web Application <https://app.wikiwatershed.org>, which is built on a fully open-source stack available at <https://github.com/WikiWatershed>.

Specific work on the BiG CZ Data Portal can be viewed at <https://github.com/WikiWatershed/model-my-watershed/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Aissue%20label%3ABigCZ%20>.
